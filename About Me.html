        <p> Hi there! My name is <em><strong>Yam Gebre.</strong></em> You may know me as the kid who only focused on fun stuff in his president commercial during the first election, and
        didn't think that there was anything else that was important. Not anymore! I am now the kid who cares about the class, is responsible, and a great role model. I still like
        video games, though. Anyways, if that <em>somehow</em> didn't convince you to vote for me, thats ok! I have made multiple web pages on this website going into great detail about
        all the things I mentioned here. See you in class!</p>
