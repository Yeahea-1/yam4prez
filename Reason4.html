    <p> An additional reason I am the best choice for class president is that I will not give up on the role. I will demonstrate commitment to making positive changes and serving others.
      I will also take the initiative to address class issues and consistently work hard to improve the overall class experience, making the classroom a better place as a whole. Now that
      you've heard yet another reason to vote for me in the class election, you're sure to <em>Vote for Yam!</em>
