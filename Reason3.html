    <p>You should vote for Yam in the 2024 presidental class election because he is responsible. If someone is responsible, they do what they are supposed to and do not mess around when it's time to  be serious. One of the reasons Yam is responsible is that he shows integrity. Integrity is doing the right thing, even when nobody is looking. This is quite the reason that you should vote for Yam in the 2024 class election!</p>
